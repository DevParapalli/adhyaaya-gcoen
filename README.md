# adhyaaya-gcoen

This is a mono-repo-like repo that will contain code, images, videos (maybe, or links to videos) that I contribute, am Interested in, or generally want to keep track of. Expect the history to be messy and large. I wouldn't recommend trying to git clone the repo. Use `npx --yes degit https://github.com/DevParapalli/adhyaaya-gcoen.git` or `git clone git@github.com:DevParapalli/adhyaaya-gcoen.git --depth 2 --branch main`. The code maybe incomplete (missing supporting libraries, package.json maybe absent), use caution. Images might be huge, Videos might be uploaded to youtube and unlisted. Large Assets maybe uploaded to Google Drive, Dropbox, MediaFire etc. Make sure you have enough bandwidth and data to download the assets if you need them. I might use `kebab-case`, `camelCase`, and `snake_case` inside code depending on code-styles, filenames will be `snake_case.ext` unless a seperate naming case is required.
